# Poltergeist Codebase Improvement Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the comprehensive refactoring of the Poltergeist codebase to align with Go best practices as outlined in the "Idiomatic Go Programming Guide 2025+". 

## Progress Summary

### ✅ Completed Improvements

#### Phase 1: Critical Safety (COMPLETED ✅)

##### 1. Error Handling - Sentinel Errors
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Changes Made**:
- Created `/pkg/daemon/errors.go` with sentinel error definitions
- Replaced all string comparisons with `errors.Is()` pattern
- Fixed daemon.go error handling to use sentinel errors

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/daemon/errors.go` (new)
- `pkg/daemon/daemon.go`

**Example**:

- Created `CLI` struct to encapsulate command handling
- Removed all global variables
- Made CLI fully testable with dependency injection

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/cli/config.go` (new)
- `pkg/cli/root_refactored.go` (new)

##### 6. Graceful Shutdown Implementation
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Changes Made**:

- Implemented graceful shutdown with timeout contexts
- Added proper resource cleanup
- Context cancellation triggers coordinated shutdown

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/cli/watch.go`
- `pkg/poltergeist/poltergeist.go`
- `pkg/daemon/daemon.go`

#### Phase 3: Observability (COMPLETED ✅)

##### 7. Structured Logging Enhancement
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Changes Made**:
- Created context-aware logging with `LoggerContext` interface
- Added `InfoContext`, `ErrorContext`, etc. methods
- Integrated correlation IDs into logging
- Replaced `fmt.Println` statements throughout codebase

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/logger/logger_context.go` (new)
- Various files updated to use structured logging

##### 8. Correlation IDs and Tracing
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Changes Made**:
- Created comprehensive context package for tracing
- Added request ID and correlation ID generation
- Implemented context enrichment functions
- Added tracing fields extraction for logging

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/context/context.go` (new)
- `pkg/logger/logger_context.go` (new)

#### Phase 4: Testing & Quality (COMPLETED ✅)

##### 9. Testing Infrastructure
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Changes Made**:
- Created comprehensive mock implementations for all interfaces
- Added table-driven tests for core functionality
- Implemented tests for panic recovery and context handling
- Added tests for dependency factory

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/mocks/mocks.go` (new)
- `pkg/poltergeist/poltergeist_test.go` (new)

##### 10. Performance Optimizations
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Changes Made**:
- Pre-allocated slices with known capacity throughout codebase
- Optimized slice operations in hot paths
- Fixed memory allocations in `handleFileChanges` and `performInitialBuilds`

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/poltergeist/poltergeist.go` (optimized slice allocations)

## Key Architectural Decisions

### SafeGroup Pattern
We've implemented a SafeGroup wrapper around errgroup that provides:
- Panic recovery in all goroutines
- Structured error logging with stack traces
- Resource limiting to prevent exhaustion
- Context-aware cancellation

### Sentinel Errors
All error comparisons now use sentinel errors with `errors.Is()`:
- Enables wrapped error chains
- Provides semantic error identity
- Improves error handling reliability

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix context flow from CLI down through all layers
2. **Short-term**: Remove hidden dependency initialization
3. **Medium-term**: Implement graceful shutdown with signal handling
4. **Long-term**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure
